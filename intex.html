            <h2>Total Utility and Marginal Utility</h2>
            <p>
                In economics, <span class="highlight">total utility</span> represents the overall satisfaction from consuming a certain quantity of a good, while <span class="highlight">marginal utility</span> is the additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit. The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility suggests that as consumption increases, marginal utility tends to decrease.
            </p>
            <p>
                The relationship between total utility and marginal utility is crucial in understanding consumer behavior and rational decision-making.

            <h2>Indifference Curves</h2>
            <p>
                Indifference curves illustrate combinations of two goods that provide the consumer with the same level of satisfaction. These curves are downward-sloping and convex, representing the principle of diminishing marginal rate of substitution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is related to the slope of the indifference curve and represents the rate at which a consumer is willing to give up one good for another while maintaining the same level of satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consumer equilibrium occurs where the highest attainable indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint line, guiding rational choices and optimal consumption.
